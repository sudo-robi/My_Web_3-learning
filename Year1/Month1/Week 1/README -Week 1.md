What I Have Learned and Understood So Far in Week One

A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on a blockchain and automatically enforces rules or agreements without needing a middleman. I also learned about Solidity pragma and versioning, and I created my first contract using pragma solidity ^0.8.0;.

I explored various data types and studied function visibility, which includes public, private, internal, and external. I also grasped the concept of function modifiers such as view, pure, and payable. In addition, I learned about important global objects like msg.value, msg.sender, block.timestamp, msg.data, and tx.origin.
