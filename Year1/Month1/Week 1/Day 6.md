Today I looked at global object like msg.value, msg.sender, block.timestamp, msg.data and tx.origin. 

'msg.value' is the amount of ETH spent with a transaction when a smart contract function is called.

'msg.sender' is the address of the account that called the current function.

'block.timestamp' is the timestamp of the block in which your transaction was included or when it was mined.

'msg.data' is the complete calldata of the function call.

'tx.origin' is the original external account that started the transaction.
