What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on a blockchain like Ethereum and others and automatically enforces rules or agreements without needing a middleman. A smart contract is code stored on the blockchain that runs exactly the way it was written.
Once deployed, nobody can change it, and it will automatically execute whenever its conditions are met.
